## Project Information

The **SmartVote** project is an intelligent voting platform that replaces traditional voting methods. It gives the user a simple and secure access to vote on things that matter in his community. The project implements BlockChain methods which makes voting secure and minimizes the risk of fraud. The project is based on [scientific research](https://skemman.is/bitstream/1946/31161/1/Research-Paper-BBEVS.pdf).

**SmartVote** is a project that takes part in [Hackathon Wizja Rozwoju `20](https://challengerocket.com/wizjarozwoju20) for smart cities.
